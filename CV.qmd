aboutme: I am passionate about the evolution of dairy cattle nutrition through the continued technical advances of feed processing and product development. My goals are to benefit producers with meaningful research on the impacts of novel feed products, new insights on energy metabolism, and effectively bridge the gap between science and real-world applications.
